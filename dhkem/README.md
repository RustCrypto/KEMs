Pure Rust implementation of the Diffie-Hellman-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism
as described in the [RFC9180 § 4.1].

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About

Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) provide a common API for establishing a
symmetric key using public-key cryptography.

This crate implements a KEM-based API for elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman as
specified for Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) which is described in
[RFC9180].

## ⚠️ Security Warning

The implementation contained in this crate has never been independently audited!

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

This crate requires **Rust 1.74** at a minimum.

We may change the MSRV in the future, but it will be accompanied by a minor
version bump.
