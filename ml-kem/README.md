Pure Rust implementation of the Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard
(formerly known as Kyber) as described in [FIPS 203] (final).

## About

ML-KEM is an algorithm which uses public-key cryptography to securely transfer a symmetric key
between two parties who want to establish encrypted communications with each other. It uses
algorithms which resist potential attacks by hypothetical future quantum computers which,
when such computers are sufficiently mature, pose a problem for the algorithms we typically use for
secure key establishment using public-key cryptography such as (EC)DH and RSA key encipherment.

Originally developed as [CRYSTALS-Kyber] (a.k.a. "Kyber"), ML-KEM is a refinement of the original
Kyber algorithm after it was selected for standardization by [NIST]'s [Post-Quantum Cryptography]
(PQC) competition. The Kyber algorithm received considerable feedback as part of the standardization
process and as such, ML-KEM includes many changes from the original Kyber. It can be though of as
the official successor of Kyber.

In summary, ML-KEM stands at the forefront of post-quantum cryptography, offering enhanced security
and efficiency in key encapsulation mechanisms to safeguard sensitive communications in an era where
quantum computers potentially pose a looming threat.
